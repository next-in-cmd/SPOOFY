#  Introduction and Problem Statement: 
**1. Addressing Problem :** Face-swap deep fake videos are becoming increasingly prevalent and more realistic, making them difficult to detect with conventional methods. This inability to accurately identify deep fakes jeopardizes trust in digital content, potentially leading to misinformation and security issues. A comprehensive and effective solution is needed to enhance detection accuracy and reliability.

**Proposed Solution :** "Spoofy" is designed to tackle the challenge of detecting face-swap deep fake videos using advanced technologies. Key features of Spoofy include:

**•	Antispoofing:** Detects subtle artifacts and inconsistencies introduced during face-swapping, differentiating between real and manipulated faces.

**•	Liveness Detection:** Verifies that the facial features in the video correspond to a live individual rather than a static image or clip, ensuring authenticity.

**•	Biometric Authentication:** Enhances security by cross-referencing detected faces with authenticated profiles to verify video credibility.
